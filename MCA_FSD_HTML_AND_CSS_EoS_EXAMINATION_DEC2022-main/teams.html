       <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Tamil Thalaivas </b> is a Kabaddi team based in Tamil Nadu that plays in the Pro Kabaddi League.[2] The team is owned by the consortium
        called Magnum Sports Private Limited, the parent company of Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters FC. Actor Vijay Sethupathi is
        the brand ambassador of the team. Tamil Thalaivas play their home matches at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium (Chennai), Tamil Nadu.

Since making its debut in the PKL, it hasn't had much success after finishing rock bottom in Zone B, both in 2017 and 2018-19. Thalaivas
 finished in 12th and 11th position in the subsequent 2019 & 2021-22 seasons. In their most successful season, TT finished 5th and qualified
  for the semi finals where they lost to Puneri Paltan in 2022.In a freak incident, Pawan Sehrawat injured himself in the first match of the
   Thalaivas season. Head coach J.Udayakumar was sacked mid-season after a bad run of form and ultra-defensive gameplay. Team India Head coach
    Ashan Kumar took charge of the team and was the reason behind team's upheaval of form.It was an interesting auction for Tamil Thalaivas
     where they picked up players such as Manjeet, Surjeet and Prapanjan for big money and forming a balanced team. Despite early season form 
     and some strong defensive displays by Sagar and Surjeet, it was an underwhelming season for Tamil Thalaivas yet again, finishing 11th in 
     the league stage. Prapanjan missed out most of the season due to injury to the dismay of the local fans. Sagar, who was retained by the 
     management was the find of the season for Tamil Thalaivas which was the only consolation. Thalaivas played attractive kabaddi with young 
    players like Narendar coming to forefront breaking the 200 raid points barrier for the season. Ajinkya Pawar played the supporting role in 
    the raiding department who was involved 2 mega 6 and 7 points raid against Telugu Titans in 2 separate matches. Sagar was the hero again 
    in the defense supported well by Sahil, Mohit and M. Abhishek. Another injury blow to Sagar near the close season brought doubts on the
     play-off qualification but Thalaivas rallied behind the coach and kept winning which resulted in play-off qualification for the first time
      in their Pro Kabaddi history after winning the crunch match against UP Yoddhas in matchday 21. Tamil Thalaivas finished 5th in the league
       table and played against UP Yoddhas in Eliminator 2. Yoddhas were defeated in the shoot out after the match ended in a tie only for the 
       second time in Pro Kabaddi KO round history. Tamil Thalaivas qualified for the semi finals for the first time where they played Puneri 
       Paltan but lost the match by 2 points despite putting up a valiant effort. Despite missing their star players in Pawan and Sagar, this
        was the most successful season in the franchise's history.

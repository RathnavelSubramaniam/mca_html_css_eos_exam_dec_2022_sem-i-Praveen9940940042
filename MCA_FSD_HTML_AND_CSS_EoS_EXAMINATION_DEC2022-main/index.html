       <h3>Standard style</h3>
       In the international team version of kabaddi, two teams of seven members each occupy opposite halves of a field of 10 by 13 metres (33 ft × 43 ft) in case of

       <h3>Circle style</h3>
       Four major forms of kabaddi played in India which are recognised by the amateur federation. In Sanjeevani kabaddi, one player is revived against one player of
        the opposite team who is out – one out. The game is played over 40 min with a 5 min break between halves. There are seven players on each side and the team 
        that outs all the players on the opponent's side scores four extra points. In Gaminee style, seven players play on either side and a player put out has to remain
         out until all his team members are out. The team that is successful in ousting all the players of the opponent's side secures a point. The game continues until five
          or seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration. Amar style resembles the Sanjeevani form in the time frame rule. But, a player who is declared out
           doesn't leave the court, but instead stays inside, and the play goes along. For every player of the opposition touched “out”, a team earns a point. Punjabi kabaddi
            is a variation that is played on a circular pitch of a radius of 22 metres.
